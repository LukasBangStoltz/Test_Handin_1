# Assignment 1 Test
All the code weve developed is also included in the repository

## 1. Reflections






### 1.1 Shooting
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.
- She missed
- She hit the man in a non-fatal spot
- The bullet she fired was a blank
- She fired an airsoftgun
- He was wearing a bulletproof west or helmet
-

### 1.2 Alien


An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step
instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with
your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)

- Open the plastic tube containing a mysterius luquid, and twist its cap counter-clockwise
- put the cap of the plastic tube down, and keep the tube in your left hand
- Pick up the plastic object with a brush at the top with your right hand
- With your left hand, squeze the liquid out from the plastic tube, so that it hits the pointy side of the brush, that you are holding in your right hand - a peasized amount should be squized
- put the plastic object with a brush up to your gum-line, and put it at a 45-degre angle
- now brush your teeth in a circulair moting, using 2 minutes in total, giving all teeth the same amount of attention
- If your mouth has too much of the mysterious liquid inside, you can spit some of it out - Do not swallow it, at any point while brushing
-Congratulations, youve learned how to brush your teeth!!

## 2. Two Katas


### 2.1 Fahrenheit-to-celcius
#### Use BDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter
we want our applicantion to transoform a given farhenheit value, into the corresponding celcius value. The value is to be recived throuh an input into the console application.

#### Use BDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.
We want our application to convert a temperature value from celsius to Fahrenheit or vice verca. The user has to decide what conversion they wanna use, before inputting their value into the application.

### 2.2 Roman Numeral Kata
We want our application to be able to take a given numeric input, and convert it it into a Roman numeral, and return it. 


## 3. Give your thought on BDD
1. What was positive and good about using BDD?
- Collective understanding. It makes it understandable to the user, backend, frontend, and testing people involved in the development.

2. What was annoying or difficult?
- Communication between user and developer. 
- The development team must be dedicated to working a lot with the client. This also demands the customer to have a short response, which requires high availability.

3. What surprised you?
- Using primarily "normal" language, writing it down, before converting it to "programming" language

4. Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more
- Yes, by specifying the behavior of the features, u create more visibility of the expectations.

5. Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?
- No not really, because when taking the TDD approach, we usually, in our head, think in "normal" language before making the test.
